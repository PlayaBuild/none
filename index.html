      <h2>Stay Subscribed – Keep Your Rank</h2>
      <p>
        To maintain your rank and keep recruiting, you must stay subscribed for
        <strong>$9.99/month.</strong>
        Unsubscribing means you lose your active QR code, and you’ll need to
        re-subscribe to generate a new one. This protects fairness and ensures
        your recruiter status stays verified.
